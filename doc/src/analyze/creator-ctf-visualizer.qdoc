    \title Visualizing Chrome Trace Events

    Several tracing tools (such as \c {chrome://about}) can generate information
    about Chrome trace events in Chrome Trace Format (CTF). You can open CTF
    files in \QC for viewing. This is especially useful when viewing trace files
    larger than 100 MB, which are difficult to view with the built-in
    trace-viewer (\c{chrome://tracing}) due to its high memory usage.

    The visualizer supports all event types used in data that the
    \l {https://lttng.org/}{LTTng} tracing framework generates, converted
    to CTF. However, some of the more advanced event types used, for example,
    in Android system traces, are not supported. The visualizer silently
    ignores unsupported event types.

    The visualizer supports the following event types:

    \list
        \li Begin, end, duration, and instant events
        \li Counter events (graphs)
        \li Metadata events (process and thread name)
    \endlist

    \section1 Opening JSON Files

    To open JSON files for viewing, select \uicontrol Analyze >
    \uicontrol {Chrome Trace Format Viewer} > \uicontrol {Load JSON File}.

    \section1 Visualizing Events

    The \uicontrol Timeline view displays a graphical representation of trace
    events and a condensed view of all recorded events.

    Each category in the timeline describes a thread in the application. Move
    the cursor on an event (1) on a row to view its duration and event category.
    To display the information only when an event is selected, disable the
    \uicontrol {View Event Information on Mouseover} button (2).

    The outline (3) summarizes the period for which data was collected. Drag
    the zoom range (4) or click the outline to move on the outline. To move
    between events, select the \uicontrol {Jump to Previous Event} and
    \uicontrol {Jump to Next Event} buttons (5).

    Select the \uicontrol {Show Zoom Slider} button (6) to open a slider that
    you can use to set the zoom level. You can also drag the zoom handles (7).
    To reset the default zoom level, right-click the timeline to open the
    context menu, and select \uicontrol {Reset Zoom}.

    \section2 Selecting Event Ranges

    You can select an event range (8) to view the time it represents or to zoom
    into a specific region of the trace. Select the \uicontrol {Select Range}
    button (9) to activate the selection tool. Then click in the timeline to
    specify the beginning of the event range. Drag the selection handle to
    define the end of the range.

    You can use event ranges also to measure delays between two subsequent
    events. Place a range between the end of the first event and the beginning
    of the second event. The \uicontrol Duration field displays the delay
    between the events in milliseconds.

    To zoom into an event range, double-click it.

    To remove an event range, close the \uicontrol Selection dialog.

    \section1 Viewing Statistics

    \image qtcreator-ctf-visualizer-statistics.png

    The \uicontrol Statistics view displays the number of samples each function
    in the timeline was contained in, in total and when on the top of the
    stack (called \c self). This allows you to examine which functions you need
    to optimize. A high number of occurrences might indicate that a function is
    triggered unnecessarily or takes very long to execute.
